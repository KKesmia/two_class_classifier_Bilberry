# two_class_classifier_Bilberry


● A git with all your code, including comments to explain the different steps : model
building, model training, validation tests... Done


● A brief write-up (1-2 pages) summarizing the process and the results. Training and
testing curves are more than welcome, some predictions on new data as well. I hope a notebook counts as a report, it is defintely worth a page.


● Once done just send an email with all the necessary links at : loic_steunou@trimble.com
with anastasiia_krestianska@trimble.com in copy. Done 


● You have around a week (a bit more is not a problem) to carry the exercise when you
receive it. a week s time due to my own work schedule
